# Implementation and Evaluation of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms in Combinatorial Optimization
Implementation and Experimental analysis of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) for sorting and for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Currently implemented algorithms:
- UMDA for permutations
- (1+1)EA for permutations
- EHBSA without template
- EHBSA with template
- Mallows Model
- Generalized Mallows Model
